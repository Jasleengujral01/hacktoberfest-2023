# The Website

The goal of this website is to display your web development skills as a collective effort. To get things rolling, I've decided to start by making a syntax highlighter for the various hello world snippets in `../hello_world/`.

## Why am I doing This?

Unfortunately, Hacktoberfest is picky. Lots of repositories people create are getting excluded from the event because they don't follow the values of the event. I'd hate to see the efforts that you've made go to waste for nothing, so this is an opportunity to create something I feel is has value to it; a use in the real world.

## How Can I help?

There will be several issues on Github that relate to various elements on the site. Pick one and ask to be assigned. If you see bugs, typos, or ways you can improve the quality of the code, feel free to do so. Over time, you'll see things coming together.
