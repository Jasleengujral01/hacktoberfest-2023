# Hacktoberfest 2023

Welcome to the 2023 Hacktoberfest! In this repository, I'd like to see how many languages the Github community knows. 

__Unfortunately, the content that I have on this repo at the time of evaluation didn't align with the values of the event, so this repository has been excluded from the event. You can still get commits and your PR as you normally would.__

The rules are simple:

- Make a Hello World program in a unique language.
- Help create a website that takes your hello world programs and displays them to the world.
- Lastly, if you wish, star and share this repository.

__Be sure to follow the steps in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file. And remember to have fun :)__
