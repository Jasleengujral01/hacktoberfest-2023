# Hacktoberfest 2023

Welcome to the 2023 Hacktoberfest! In this repository, I'd like to see how many languages the Github community knows. 

The rules are simple:

- Make a Hello World program in a unique language.
- If you are up for a challenge, help create a HTML5 Canvas game in `./games/`.
- Lastly, if you wish, star and share this repository.

Be sure to follow the steps in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file. And remember to have fun :)
